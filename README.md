I don't know if metabook already exist. I don't know if there are Latex macros already available for doing what I'm going to do. If I ever find them I'll try to use them nevertheless.
So this pretends to be a metabook. Something written in Latex that lets you build:

* An official book (Original intended output)
* An extended (with the author's comments) book
* Theatrical script (Not interested in this part. Might be left to be done from a fork.)
* Film script
* Scenario descriptions
* Character dialogs

The idea is having each sequence, conversation or chapter in a single file so that's easy to manage.
However in this single sequence all the metadata for producing all the binaries outputs should be there.

The project will probably generate some latex macros which could be thought as libraries. I might relicense these scripts with something other than CC-BY-SA-4.0 in the future.

If you are not interested in the writing or developing of the metabook I hope you enjoy the "Official book".
